## Learning Outcomes

From this project, I learned:
1. How to integrate third-party APIs (like OpenWeather API) into a React application.
2. The benefits of using **JavaScript** for type checking and maintaining code quality.
3. Effective state management using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
4. Creating a fully responsive layout using modern CSS techniques.

## Future Improvements

Here are some potential improvements for future versions of the app:
1. **Add a 7-day weather forecast** to provide extended weather information.
2. Implement **location-based weather updates** using the browser's geolocation API.
3. Improve UI/UX by adding animations or transitions for loading states.
4. Allow users to **save favorite cities** for quick access.
5. Add **dark mode support** for better user accessibility.
